# Other Writers

I'm a big fan of reading software blogs, and I use this page to note down interesting writers or articles that I think are a good read.

## Writers - Individual

- https://www.kitchensoap.com/

## Specific articles

This section is focused more around specific articles rather than writers themselves, although there's some overlap. 

- https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/ - I think this is my favourite blog post ever. Admittedly it was written in ~2013, so is outdated in some areas, but it's one that I consistently come back to.
