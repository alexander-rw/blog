# A decade of engineering

I've been writing software in some form for over a decade. I've had a few different roles at a few different companies. 
This blog is the culmination of my thoughts about my career, and the tech leadership experience that I've built up over the last decade, coalescing to a single point: 
sometimes, getting out of the way of the people that you lead is the best thing to do.

## My first professional opportunity

I started programming back in school; A friend of mine introduced me to MS Access and VBA and we spend time during our IT classes working out what we could do with technology (and causing mischief). 
It wasn't until I was a few years older, though, that I really started enjoying writing code. I tinkered with things I owned, tried (and mostly failed) to learn java when attempting to build mods in minecraft.

At the age of 17, I had an opportunity to do a 6 week paid internship at Barclays Bank (as part of a company called Career Academies, now [Career Ready](https://careerready.org.uk/)). Two things were abundantly clear to me:

1. I enjoyed programming in a professional setting (and was ok at it)
2. A lot of people that were engineers didn't do computer science at degree level, so I'd probably be ok not doing the same

At that point, I was already fairly deep into applying for physics undergraduate degrees, so having a career path for after university was a nice. I ended up not enjoying my degree, for numerous reasons, 
but it did prepare me for something common in software and more senior professional roles: ambiguous problem solving is part of the game, and (in my opinion) is the fun bit.

After that, I went to university and eventually landed my first real software job: Software Engineer @ Tessella.
They were (are) a consultancy that developed solutions for complex domains, with many clients in the life sciences, chemicals, and other industries where knowledge about the domain that you worked in was just as important as the software that you built and maintained.

I spent most of my time at Tessella working on projects for AkzoNobel. Readers of this blog may know AkzoNobel as the company that own Dulux, but may not know that there's a whole other world of high performance paint coatings for other applications than the wall of your kitchen or living room. I worked on a few projects at Tessella that focused on the coatings for ships, and anything related to that - including, how to chart an optimal course for a boat and then re-paint the ship's hull in dry-dock. For a large container vessel, the (relatively) small cost of a strip and re-paint, with a high quality low drag coating, of the entire hull that sits around the waterline, would run in the region of tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds (or more). [It would also save many times that in fuel costs](https://www.international-marine.com/en/news/akzonobel-and-tesella-win-leading-it-award) over the ship's lifetime, and reduce carbon emissions along the way - a win/win for both the company and the climate.

I found this work really interesting, and I learned a lot from my peers and my manager. The patience that they showed me is something that I've tried to take with me into other jobs.

## The next few years

After Tessella, I worked at a couple of other places: Altitude Angel, a company that focused on integrating drones into aviation airspace, and Zing Dev, a pure-play twilio consultancy. 

Moving between these three companies taught me something important about the sort of work that _I_ like to do: I find it significantly harder to do work consultancy-style, compared to product-style. 
The two aren't fundamentally different, but the balance of work is. I found that at both Tessella (a large consultancy), and Zing (a much smaller consultancy), the same was true:
you traded off thinking about and impacting strategic work with clients, for direct ownership and experience managing, improving, and running the software you built. 
It was a tradeoff at becoming a better product thinker, vs deepening technical skills. Consultancy also taught me to context switch pretty well, but I didn't enjoy it. I found it much more rewarding to work on a product (or set of related products).

By the time I left Zing, I was leading projects for our client portfolio that, role wise, was something between technical lead and TPM. 
I had to think about overrunning budgets, delivery of quality vs speed, and managing clients, with IC work thrown in there. I liked this sort of work, and wanted to do more - at a larger company with more engineers, and therefore more surface area to influence.

## Tech Leading a Data Platform Team

In november 2023, I joined Liberis' data platform team.

In december 2024, our engineering manager went on maternity leave and I took over the management of the team for the year. This was hard; it took me a few months to re-balance and manage the change in workload, from much more IC work to management, with more strategic, longer term thinking and stakeholder management on a team that was underresourced for the amount of work it needed to do.

In June, Liberis went full on into delivery mode to launch a new ambitious product, and needed to be able to answer questions of the commercial performance of our product. I'd been tasked with leading a cross functional project that did this; work ranged from backend contributions for our new services to be able to handle established and rapidly evolving data models, to data and analytics engineering to model the data we were getting into our systems into something that was useful for commercial and product teams to be able to bite at and answer questions.

## Raising the ceiling, not the floor

In late july 2024, I went to get a coffee with someone in the industry I respect a lot, after meeting at a conference. A single moment **really** stuck out to me in that conversation. We were discussing technical leadership, and I was asking for any tips around how to handle large, cross functional projects. I asked this specifically because I'd lead these before at Liberis, was leading one again, and found that they went ok, but not great.

I was given a simple but incredibly impactful piece of advice: Identify the person that's most capable of replacing you, so that you can move onto more impactful things. This is a requirement for staff+ level engineers, and is also where I get a lot of my energy - teaching someone to be able to do something without you might not be great for job security, but the feeling of watching someone you've mentored be able to take what you have taught them and apply that learning is unparalleled.

The whole idea of raising the ceiling of a team, not the floor was implicit to me, but having is spelled out bare made me rethink the way that I approached mentoring the cross-functional team that I was working with. 

## Getting out of the way

I decided at the end of 2025 to move on from Liberis. 

## The aftermath

Getting out of the way doesn't always mean leaving - to me, it can also mean internally moving so that, or it can mean slowly peeling away certain aspects of leadership and delegating that responsibility
to your team, so that they are able to take on and prioritise without as much input from you.
What it does mean, regardless of the outcome, is building lasting socio-technical structures that the team(s) you are leaving can use as a foundation to continue delivering. That's the hard bit, but one I've found really fun so far in my career.
